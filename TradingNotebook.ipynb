    "Our goal today will be to trade the spread of two very non-ESG ETF's, the VanEck Oil Services ETF (OIH) and Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE). OIH is attempting to track the MVISÂ® US Listed Oil Services 25 Index, which consists of 'U.S.-listed companies involved in oil services to the upstream oil sector, which include oil equipment, oil services, or oil drilling.' In comparison, XLE is dynamically changing to best represent the energy component of the S&P500 index, and currently (4th of April 2022) holds 21 companies, with the mandate '[XLE] Seeks to provide precise exposure to companies in the oil, gas and consumable fuel, energy equipment and services industries'.\n",
